   - Need professional liability insurance (especially for renting spaces or working with clinics).
   - Confusion and friction around pension / קרנות השתלמות / long-term savings.
   - Annual tax reporting to רשות המיסים is stressful and time-consuming.

## 5. Target Segments

### 5.1 Therapists

- **New solo therapists (0–2 years)**  
  Need visibility, guidance on admin/finance, low-cost entry.

- **Growing independents (2–5+ years)**  
  Already have a client base, want stability, optimization, and smarter admin.

- **Small clinics / centers**  
  Multi-therapist operations that need “multi-profile + shared admin” features.

**Service needs:**  
- Insurance only → have accountant/pension covered.  
- Financial duo → focus on pension + tax.  
- Full-stack → want one place to source all three via partners.

### 5.2 Clients

- Issue-driven (e.g., anxiety, pain, fertility).
- Modality believers (e.g., Reiki, acupuncture).
- Recommendation-followers (validate a name they got elsewhere).
- Budget-sensitive (price range important).
- Location-first (near home / work).
- Remote-preferring (video/phone OK, care more about language & fit).

---

## 6. Differentiation

- Focused on **alternative/complementary** therapists + adjacent regulated professionals, not just generic mental-health directories.
- **Trust-first UX**: credentials, badges, moderated reviews, and clear disclaimers.
- Deep focus on **therapist admin & financial services** with workflow tracking, not just listing + booking.
- Built specifically for **Israel** – language, law, financial/tax structure, and partner ecosystem.

## 9. Key Risks & High-level Mitigations

- **Adoption risk (therapists)** – start with specific niches, partner with schools/associations, and offer generous early adopter benefits.
- **Trust/compliance risk** – strict verification & moderation, strong legal review, and clear role boundaries for partners.
- **Data/privacy risk** – implement robust security practices, comply with local privacy law, and minimize sensitive data storage.
- **Monetization misalignment** – transparent pricing, low friction to join, revenue primarily from partners at first, then carefully introduce subscriptions.
